# Description

Balls and turrets is the most acclaimed game of KinesisGames yet. Unlike most of the other games produced by the latter, Balls and turrets is an arcade game and isn't just aimless and open-world. The gameplay is pretty simple to understand. The player controls a tank. He has to shoot down 'balls' coming at him. The player will earn coins in successfully doing so. If not, his tank will eventually be damaged and he will lose. High scores are kept for showing off with friends. Coins earned from levels may be used to upgrade the player's tank or buy additions to it such as new turrets and accessories. Different types of tanks are available for buying too. Tanks, turrets and terrains can be customized (skins) and a streaks system make the game more enjoyable. While playing, heartBoxes, coins and mines will appear to help the player or the fellow balls. Powerups such as shields, double bullets, double speed, slow-mo and the echo destroy will surely prove to be useful too. Coins and can be easily obtained by completing challenges. After dying, these gems can be used to revive the player.

With time, the UI and the graphics of the game will be improved. There will also be a campaign mode with levels and aims/objectives. Levels will take place in different environments and will have various new features. The current endless mode will be made better too. For example, a gem system will be implemented so that the player can use revives whenever he dies to continue playing. Moreover, new accessories, tanks, and bullet genres/ammo, and skins will be available to purchase in the shop. Finally, there will probably be the addition of a local multiplayer mode.
