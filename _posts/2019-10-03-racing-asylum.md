# Description

Racing Asylum is the second game created by KinesisGames. There are cool menus
and some levels to choose from and play. You can free roam in some environments
or race against a maximum of 3 opponents. The time for the last race you have
done is recorded too. There is a Minimap to guide you in the races and the
Nitrous makes the game fun and easy. The game was recently removed from Google
Play as some more improvements need to be done and a lot of new things need to
be added.
